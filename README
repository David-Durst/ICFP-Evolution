To run the evolution extension, build the same way as below. Then go into estrat. Then execute

    ./mutrun.sh basic_1 basic_2 &> evolutionlog

The output will be piped evolutionlog. Just kill with CTRL-C when you are sick of evolution.

This is the old stuff that I didn't write. It still works.
Building requires OCaml and SDL.

Build with

	./make.sh

Run with

	./run2.sh data/sample2.world submission/solution-1.ant submission/solution-2.ant
